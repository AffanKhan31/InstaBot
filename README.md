# InstaBot
This is a bot I made using python and the selenium webdriver framework to automate interactions with the chrome browser. The app logs in to the Instagram website using log in credentials passed in by the user and scrapes the users follower and following. It then compares the two to find out who is not following the user back then returns those Instagram ID's.
